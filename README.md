## Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ Vault Hill (_August - October 2023_)**
- Secured a major contract by enhancing ChatBot responsiveness by 70%, achieved through spearheading the design and implementation of a cutting-edge AI POC using Llama-2, AWS Sagemaker, AWS S3 bucket.
- Boosted data quality for LLM fine-tuning by 30% by designing and implementing an efficient web crawler equipped with regular expressions, covering all stages of the end-to-end ETL pipeline from data collection to processing.
- Achieved a 35% reduction in estimated costs by applying MLOps concepts to productionise model with the least perplexity score after training and evaluating, utilising deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, Langchain, and AWS.
- Enhanced knowledge sharing and collaboration within and outside organisation by authoring 2 detailed system process documentations, visualising insights from trained models to support stakeholders' comprehension.

## Projects
### [Robust Medical Image Segmentation - DeepLabsV3+ with Attention]()

For my first research project and master's dissertation, I embarked on optimizing the DeepLabsV3+ model for medical image segmentation. Through a series of experiments, I discovered that variants of DeepLabsV3+ equipped with attention mechanisms like CMAB and SEBlock significantly outperformed the base version in terms of accuracy and segmentation quality. Additionally, I proposed a novel loss function that incorporates both Binary Cross Entropy and Dice Loss, enhancing the model's performance by addressing the unique challenges of medical image segmentation.

### [Automated Attention Tracking and Reporting system](https://github.com/munas-git/Automated-Attention-Tracking-And-Reporting) (Computer Vision)   

The Automated Attention Tracking and Reporting system is a sleek AI-driven dashboard that provides real-time monitoring and reporting of distraction levels during classes, meetings, or lectures. Utilizing advanced computer vision techniques to help educators and facilitators enhance focus and attention during sessions.

### [Extractive, Abatractive document/text Summarizing System.](https://github.com/munas-git/text-summarization-webapp) (NLP)

The document summarizing system, developed as my final year project for a B.Sc. in Software Engineering at Babcock University, goes beyond basic summarization. It accurately predicts and suggests the top 2 topics for any text input, detects the language of the text, and features text-to-speech functionality to read summaries aloud. Additionally, users can download their summaries as Word documents (.docx).
