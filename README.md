## Projects
### [Robust Medical Image Segmentation - DeepLabsV3+ with Attention]() (Computer Vision)

For my master's dissertation, I extensively researched optimizing the DeepLabV3+ architecture for medical image segmentation. Through rigorous experimentation, I developed enhanced variants of DeepLabV3+ by integrating attention mechanisms, specifically Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SEBlock) attention, applied in parallel within the encoder. These attention-equipped models consistently outperformed the base DeepLabV3+ and other published research works across multiple medical imaging datasets, including breast cancer ultrasound, lung X-rays, and skin lesions.

### [Automated Attention Tracking and Reporting system](https://github.com/munas-git/Automated-Attention-Tracking-And-Reporting) (Computer Vision)   

The Automated Attention Tracking and Reporting system is a sleek AI-driven dashboard that provides real-time monitoring and reporting of distraction levels during classes, meetings, or lectures. Utilizing advanced computer vision techniques to help educators and facilitators enhance focus and attention during sessions.

### [Extractive, Abatractive document/text Summarizing System.](https://github.com/munas-git/text-summarization-webapp) (NLP)

The document summarizing system developed as my final year project for a B.Sc. in Software Engineering at Babcock University goes beyond basic summarization. It accurately predicts and suggests the top 2 topics for any text input, detects the language of the text and features text-to-speech functionality to read summaries aloud. Additionally, users can download their summaries as Word documents (.docx).
