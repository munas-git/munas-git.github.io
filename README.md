### [Robust Medical Image Segmentation - DeepLabsV3+ with Attention]() (Computer Vision)

Extensive research on optimising the DeepLabV3+ architecture for medical image segmentation. Through rigorous experimentation, I developed enhanced variants of DeepLabV3+ by integrating attention mechanisms, specifically Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SEBlock) attention, applied in parallel within the encoder. These attention-equipped models consistently outperformed the base DeepLabV3+ and other published research works across multiple medical imaging datasets, including breast cancer ultrasound, lung X-rays, and ISIC skin lesions 2017.

### [Extractive, Abatractive document/text Summarizing System.](https://github.com/munas-git/text-summarization-webapp) (NLP)

The document summarizing system developed as my final year project for a B.Sc. in Software Engineering at Babcock University goes beyond basic summarization. It accurately predicts and suggests the top 2 topics for any text input, detects the language of the text and features text-to-speech functionality to read summaries aloud. Additionally, users can download their summaries as Word documents (.docx).
