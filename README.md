## Projects
### [Robust Medical Image Segmentation - DeepLabsV3+ with Attention]() (Computer Vision)

For my first research project and master's dissertation, I embarked on optimizing the DeepLabsV3+ model for medical image segmentation. Through a series of experiments, I discovered that variants of DeepLabsV3+ equipped with attention mechanisms like CMAB and SEBlock significantly outperformed the base version in terms of accuracy and segmentation quality. Additionally, I proposed a novel loss function that incorporates both Binary Cross Entropy and Dice Loss, enhancing the model's performance by addressing the unique challenges of medical image segmentation.

### [Automated Attention Tracking and Reporting system](https://github.com/munas-git/Automated-Attention-Tracking-And-Reporting) (Computer Vision)   

The Automated Attention Tracking and Reporting system is a sleek AI-driven dashboard that provides real-time monitoring and reporting of distraction levels during classes, meetings, or lectures. Utilizing advanced computer vision techniques to help educators and facilitators enhance focus and attention during sessions.

### [Extractive, Abatractive document/text Summarizing System.](https://github.com/munas-git/text-summarization-webapp) (NLP)

The document summarizing system developed as my final year project for a B.Sc. in Software Engineering at Babcock University goes beyond basic summarization. It accurately predicts and suggests the top 2 topics for any text input, detects the language of the text and features text-to-speech functionality to read summaries aloud. Additionally, users can download their summaries as Word documents (.docx).
